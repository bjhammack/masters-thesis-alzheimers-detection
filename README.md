 My masters thesis where I built a model pipeline using a CNN, SVM, and a custom SMOTE oversampling technique to identify and classify Alzheimer's in brain CT scans.

 For details on my process, techinques, and results please refer to [my paper]().

 Data and exported models have been excluded to their sheer size not being ideal for GitHub.
