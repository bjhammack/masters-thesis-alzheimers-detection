# Masters Thesis: Alzheimers Detection and Classification
 My masters thesis where I built a model pipeline using a CNN, SVM, and a custom SMOTE oversampling technique to identify and classify Alzheimer's in brain CT scans.

 For details on my process, techniques, and results please refer to [my paper](https://github.com/bjhammack/masters-thesis-alzheimers-detection/blob/main/thesis_paper.pdf).

 Data and exported models have been excluded due to their sheer size not being ideal for GitHub.
